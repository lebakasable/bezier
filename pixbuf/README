The pixbuf module provides support for working with image data as buffers of
pixels. A buffer is created with a given pixel format and size by calling
[[newbuffer]] (or [[newbuffer_static]]). Buffers may be filled with a uniform
color using [[fill], copied to one another with [[copy]], or converted between
formats with [[convert]].

No additional operations are provided. Drawing operations, loading or saving
pixel data from compressed image formats, etc, is provided by separate modules.
