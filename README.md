# bezier

Experimentations with [BÃ©zier Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)s.

To build the project, you'll need to install the [Hare](https://harelang.org/) programming language, and the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) library.

You can place markers with the left mouse click, move them, switch between curve/markers rendering modes with `Tab` and clear the screen with `Return`.
